# 🧪 Laboratory Practices - Practice 1 - Redes de sensores electrónicos

This repository contains the first laboratory practice for the **Redes de sensores electrónicos** course. Each section is organized in its own folder and includes the necessary files along with a brief description.
In this practice, we will explore the basics of working with the Arduino Nano 33 sense BLE.

## 📖 Section Overview

### 📁 Section 1 - 01_sleep
📌 First working code to print on Serial Monitor the value captured on an Analog Pin.  
📄 Main files:  
- `01_sleep.ino`: Using sleep() to print every second the value obtained.

### 📁 Section 2 - 02_timers
📌 Same result as in the previous section, but a better approach by using interupt timers so as not to inutilize the board
📄 Main files:  
- `02_timers.ino`: main code used in order to print on screen the values obtained

### 📁 Section 3 - 03_PWM
📌 Working with PWM signals in order to obtain a 5kHz signal with varible duty  cycle
📄 Main files:  
- `03_PWM.ino`: creating PWM signal.
